<th>Summarize about Me:</th>
<td colspan="2" style="text-align:justify">I am a rather quiet or introvet person and a person who is detailed in doing something. I like to understand everything I do to have good results. According to my friend, I have a rather fierce face and my nature is also quite firm, making it difficult for people to approach me because they feel I am an arrogant person. But for anyone who knows me they know what my true nature is, which is a simple person unlike what people around me imagine. It is funny, but what I am saying is based on what my friends are telling me. Next, the skills I acquire, maybe in memorizing this because I like to remember something even though the thing is old and unimportant, but sometimes I am also a forgetful person. In addition, I also have some skills in drawing and coloring that may be influenced by the genetics of my mother and father who love the field of art, but are not very skilled. Next, in relation to my nature as well, I am a person who hates lies. This is because, when I make friends with someone I will consider them as important people to me so if they lie it hurts a lot. I love everyone around me even though sometimes they don't care about me. One of my shortcoming is that maybe I find it hard to forgive people and even though I forgive I will never forget.This is a summary of myself, I am also a normal human being with shortcomings and abilities.</td>
